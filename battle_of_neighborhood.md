### Description of the Problem and Background

**Scenario:**
I am presently living in Delhi, India within walking distance to metro station and enjoy many ammenities and venues in the area, such as various restaurants, cafes, food shops and entertainment now have to relocate to Manhattan, NY to work in a leading firm as a new opportunity. I am very excited for this opportunity, and need to search a place to live according to my needs. There are some question I need to resolve before I move to Manhattan. The key question is : to find a place similar to mine now in Delhi. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Manhattan NY, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Manhattan must meet the following demands:

apartment must be of 2 or 3 bedrooms
desired location is near a metro station in the Manhattan area and within 1.0 mile (1.6 km) radius
price of rent not exceed $7,000 per month
top ammenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence
desirable to have venues such as coffee shops, restaurants Indians, gym and food shops
as a reference, I have included a map of venues near current residence in Delhi.

<br> **Business Problem:**
The challenge is to find a suitable apartment for rent in Manhattan NY that complies with the demands on location, price and venues. The data required to resolve this challenge is described in the following section 2, below.

<br> **Interested Audience**
I believe this is a relevant challenge with valid questions for anyone moving to other large city in US, EU or Asia. The same methodology can be applied in accordance to demands as applicable. This case is also applicable for anyone interested in exploring starting or locating a new business in any city. Lastly, it can also serve as a good practical exercise to develop Data Science skills.
